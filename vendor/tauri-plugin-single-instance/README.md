## Install

_This plugin requires a Rust version of at least **1.77.2**_

There are three general methods of installation that we can recommend.

1. Use crates.io and npm (easiest, and requires you to trust that our publishing pipeline worked)
2. Pull sources directly from Github using git tags / revision hashes (most secure)
3. Git submodule install this repo in your tauri project and then use file protocol to ingest the source (most secure, but inconvenient to use)

Install the Core plugin by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-single-instance = "2.0.0"
# alternatively with Git:
tauri-plugin-single-instance = { git = "https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace", branch = "v2" }
```

## Usage

First you need to register the core plugin with Tauri:

`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`

```rust
use tauri::{Manager};

#[derive(Clone, serde::Serialize)]
struct Payload {
    args: Vec<String>,
    cwd: String,
}

fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_single_instance::init(|app, argv, cwd| {
            println!("{}, {argv:?}, {cwd}", app.package_info().name);
            app.emit("single-instance", Payload { args: argv, cwd }).unwrap();
        }))
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

Note that currently, plugins run in the order they were added in to the builder, so make sure that this plugin is registered first.

## Usage with Flatpak/Snap

If you use Flatpak/Snap to publish your package and your Tauri identifier doesn't match the package id, set the `DBUS_ID` variable using the builder for the plugin, look at example.
